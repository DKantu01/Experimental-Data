Thesis Experimental Data
In this section, we present data for the three tasks conducted in the behavioral experiment. For each task we present the final selection of alternatives. 
We had five alternatives in tasks 1 and 2 (alternatives in {1,2,3,4,5}) whereas  we have ten alternatives in task 3 (alternatives in {1,2,3, ..., 10}).
